Integrated Platform develepped by our team
```

This final integrated model resumes all three models mentioned above in one automatic model
The characteristics of this model are :

• Multiple Models platform: when using this integrated model , it first asks the user
to choose one of the three models to start working with. The configuration and the
options proposed depend on this choice.
• Multiple options : Our integrated model propose multiple option do perform forecasting
on any number of days. The user can ask to do forecasting using dynamic method or
step by step method. Dynamic method forecast sales on any period of time using only
past data , the second method needs to retrain the model after each forecast using the
real value of the prediction.
• Multi-usage : this model can be used to describe and analyze data or to forecast future
sales
• Auto-Configuration : the model propose a high level configuration method that does
not require any technical knowledge to perform forecasting
• Auto-Error handler : the model handle or internal error so that is does not interrupt
forecasting when used for multiple locations.

```
How to run it
```

Super easy , you just run program runner.py  (command : python porgram_runner.py) in the same folder after you download this respository
It's guided , no knowledge needed to perform forecasting.

```
Can I modify this platform
```

The models in this platform are seprated , and each class is also seperated so you can add other models or delete them , or add other features , or add others options
This is a beta version that show a great results but it can be improved by adding graphical interface to it
